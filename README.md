# AuthServ2.0
The descendant of AuthServ

AuthServ1.0 was meant to be a learning project, and so is this one!
There were a few things I was not satisfied with in the original.

NOTE: This is in no way supposed to be put into use and if it ever was, you would end up with security issues and bugs that may never be fixed. Please NEVER use this in any project unless you are confident you want a security issue.
